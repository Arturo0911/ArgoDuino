    Producing yogurt requires milk to acidify, wehereupon curs are
    formed. This acidification process, which has to be rapid in
    industrial settings, largegly depens on the growth and the activity
    of bacteria that produce lactic acid by fermenting lactose. The
    association between the two yogurt lactic acid bacteria (LAB)
    Streptococcus Thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgarius is regarded
    as a procooperation because it's befeicial for both species, but
    each bacterium can grow alone in milk. Tis protocooperation has
    industrial importance because it can improve yogurtÂ¿s properties,
    such as the texture, the acidification rate and the flavor.
