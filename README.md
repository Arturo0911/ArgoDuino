<p>
One of the most important environmental factors for growth and
survival of LAB is pH. Although most LAB species are frequently isolated
from acid habitats and can tolerate pH values below 5.0, it is necessary to determine their optimum growth pH prior to applying them in fermented
food production [9, 10]. An inadequate pH during the growth of LAB leads
to alterations in the stability of their membranes, hinders their capacity to exchange of hydrogenions, and can inhibit their enzymatic activity, resulting in a negative effect on yield.
